            developers to craft high-quality mobile apps, with native interfaces, using a single code base. It is one of
            the prime choices for cross-platform app development, like React Native, that helps build beautiful
            applications suitable for both iOS and Android. <br>

                  As the development time is different for each platform, we determine the cost of Flutter application
                  development based on the total hours spent by our resources and multiply it with our hourly rates. The
                  price varies if you opt for cross-platform development rather than choosing to develop two native
                  apps.
